# Text-To-Speech

The basic concept behind the text-to-speech (TTS) conversion system is to enable users to easily convert
written text into audible speech through a web-based interface. The system consists of two main components:
the backend and the frontend. The backend handles the text-to-speech conversion using Python and the
Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library, while the frontend provides a user-friendly interface for text input
and interaction. 
The primary goal of this TTS system is to provide users with high-quality, natural-sounding speech output
from text input, supporting multiple languages. The system leverages machine learning models within gTTS
to generate speech, ensuring accurate pronunciation and intonation.
